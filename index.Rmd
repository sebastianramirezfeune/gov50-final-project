## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to race and Latinidad. I would like to find data on who identified as "Latino/Hispanic" in the most recent census. Then, I would like to observe the racial proportions of those identifying as Latino or Hispanic: whether they identify as Black, White, Indigenous, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Other. If the data is available, I would also want to record each respondent's country of origin. I plan to then compare this data to racial proportions within the countries of origin to see if certain racial demographics are living in the United States while others are remaining home.
