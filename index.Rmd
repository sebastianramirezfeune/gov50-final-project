## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to race and Latinidad. I would like to find data on who identified as "Latino/Hispanic" in the most recent census in major cities across the USA. With this data, I would like to observe the racial proportions of those identifying as Latino or Hispanic: whether they identify as Black, White, Indigenous, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Other. Additionally, I would also like for my data to include their income levels. This way, I will be able to track the general regional trends of how Latinos across the USA racially identify, comparing Latinos in New York City to those in Los Angeles, and so on. My end goal is to see if there are any regional concentrations in the United States where Latinos identify as a certain race more than other regions, and if there is any link between the self-identified race and income level of those respondents.
